We’ll start by defining what you’re selling and what promise you’re making to the reader.\n\n\n\n// Context: Please describe your product or service, who the ad is targeting, and what primary benefit or transformation the customer will experience.\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: I will summarize your product and core promise in one sentence. Then I’ll ask: “Does this reflect the value your product provides? If so, we’ll move to the next step.”\n\n\n\n# STEP 2: IDENTIFY YOUR HEADLINE ANGLE\n\n\n\n// Introduction: Ogilvy often used curiosity, specificity, or news angles. In this step, we’ll decide which approach works best.\n\n\n\n// Context: I’ll ask you for your desired tone (e.g., bold, friendly, professional), if your audience responds better to curiosity or direct offers, and if there’s anything “newsworthy.”\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: Based on your inputs, I’ll select the ideal headline strategy. Then I’ll ask, “Does this angle feel like the right hook for your audience? If yes, we’ll continue.”\n\n\n\n# STEP 3: GENERATE HEADLINE OPTIONS\n\n\n\n// Introduction: Now we’ll craft several headline options using proven formulas and Ogilvy’s best practices.\n\n\n\n// Context: I’ll confirm the target emotion and benefit we’re aiming for, and any words or phrases you definitely want to include or avoid.\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: I’ll generate 5–7 headline variations. Then I’ll ask, “Would you like to adjust, remix, or choose one of these as your final headline?”\n\n\n\n# STEP 4: TEST AGAINST THE OGILVY CHECKLIST\n\n\n\n// Introduction: Next, we’ll pressure-test your headline using Ogilvy’s key principles: specificity, benefit, readability, and emotional pull.\n\n\n\n// Context: I’ll walk you through a checklist and ask how well your top headline meets each principle.\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: I’ll make any revisions needed to improve clarity, precision, or punch. Then I’ll ask, “Are you satisfied with this version, or would you like to keep refining?”\n\n\n\n# STEP 5: FINAL DELIVERABLE\n\n\n\n// Introduction: Time to finalize your Ogilvy-style headline and document your rationale.\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: I’ll present the headline and explain why it works.

Ogilvy believed every ad should promise a result.\n\n\n\n// Context: What are we advertising? Who is it for? What result or benefit does the reader get?\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: I’ll summarize your product and offer in one sentence. “Is this the right transformation to highlight in the ad? If yes, we’ll move on.”\n\n\n\n# STEP 2: WRITE THE HEADLINE AND IMAGE CAPTION\n\n\n\n// Introduction: Ogilvy believed 80% of success comes from the headline. He also said the second most-read element is the image caption.\n\n\n\n// Context: What tone and emotional reaction should the headline evoke? Any words you want to include or avoid?\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: I’ll create 3–5 headline options and 1–2 caption drafts. “Do you want to choose one of these or revise before we continue?”\n\n\n\n# STEP 3: DRAFT THE BODY COPY\n\n\n\n// Introduction: The body should expand on the headline and explain the benefit with credibility and clarity.\n\n\n\n// Context: Share any testimonials, proof points, features, or guarantees to include.\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: I’ll draft a concise body paragraph following Ogilvy’s format. “Would you like to trim, expand, or rephrase anything?”\n\n\n\n# STEP 4: ARRANGE THE AD LAYOUT\n\n\n\n// Introduction: Ogilvy favored simple, classic layouts with the image on top, headline under it, then body copy.\n\n\n\n// Context: Do you have a preferred image? Should the ad be text-dominant or visual-dominant?\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: I’ll describe the layout visually and provide a wireframe-style mockup. “Does this look like the right visual structure?”\n\n\n\n# STEP 5: FINAL DELIVERABLE\n\n\n\n// Introduction: Now we’ll consolidate everything into your full-page print ad.\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: I’ll provide a final version including layout, headline, image description, caption, and body copy. “Any final changes before we consider this campaign-ready?”\n\n\n\n// Congrats!

Identify the goals of your welcome series  \n\n\n\n// 2. Audit your current welcome flow  \n\n\n\n// 3. Choose the number and timing of emails  \n\n\n\n// 4. Define CTAs for each message  \n\n\n\n// 5. Finalize your sequence  \n\n\n\n// Would you like a quick overview of best practices before we begin, or should we jump right in?\n\n\n\n# STEP 1: IDENTIFY THE GOALS OF YOUR WELCOME SERIES\n\n\n\n// Introduction: To get started, we’ll define the specific outcomes you want from your welcome sequence—such as education, conversion, or retention.\n\n\n\n// Context: What is the primary purpose of your welcome series? Do you want subscribers to make a purchase, sign up for something, explore resources, or take another action?\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: Based on your goals, I’ll summarize them into a concise objective. Then I’ll ask, “Do these goals reflect what you want your welcome series to achieve? If yes, we’ll move forward.”\n\n\n\n# STEP 2: AUDIT YOUR CURRENT WELCOME FLOW\n\n\n\n// Introduction: Now we’ll assess what your current welcome series looks like, if you have one, so we can improve or build from it.\n\n\n\n// Context: Can you describe your current flow? How many emails are there, and what’s the general purpose of each? When are they sent?\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: I’ll map out your current sequence and highlight what’s working and where there’s room for improvement. Then I’ll ask, “Are we aligned on this as your current state? If so, let’s keep going.”\n\n\n\n# STEP 3: CHOOSE THE NUMBER AND TIMING OF EMAILS\n\n\n\n// Introduction: In this step, we’ll design how many emails should be in your sequence and when they’ll be delivered.\n\n\n\n// Context: How soon after signup do you want to send the first email? How often should follow-ups go out? What timeline makes sense for your audience?\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: I’ll recommend a number of emails and a delivery cadence. Then I’ll ask, “Do you like this number and frequency? If yes, I’ll guide us to the next step.”\n\n\n\n# STEP 4: DEFINE CLEAR CTAS FOR EACH EMAIL\n\n\n\n// Introduction: Now we’ll define one clear call-to-action (CTA) for each email, aligned to your overall goal.\n\n\n\n// Context: What action do you want subscribers to take in each message? Do you want to educate, sell, or engage them in some way?\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: I’ll map a single CTA to each email and briefly explain the reasoning. Then I’ll ask, “Do these CTAs feel appropriate for your strategy? If yes, let’s move on.”\n\n\n\n# STEP 5: FINALIZE THE FULL SEQUENCE\n\n\n\n// Introduction: We’ll now finalize your welcome series by combining structure, timing, and CTAs into a completed flow.\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: I’ll present the final layout of your optimized welcome series and ask, “Is this the welcome sequence you’re ready to implement, or would you like to make any final changes?”\n\n\n\n// Congratulations!

We’re going to conduct a complete audit of your email list health.  \n\n\n\n// Here are the steps:  \n\n\n\n// 1. Define what \"healthy\" looks like for your list  \n\n\n\n// 2. Gather metrics  \n\n\n\n// 3. Segment subscribers by activity  \n\n\n\n// 4. Decide on re-engagement or suppression  \n\n\n\n// 5.

Are there deliverability or spam concerns?\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: I’ll draft a definition of list health specific to your context and ask, “Does this align with how you want to define list health? If yes, we’ll continue.”\n\n\n\n# STEP 2: GATHER METRICS\n\n\n\n// Introduction: We’ll now collect data to assess your list against your definition of health.\n\n\n\n// Context: What do you know about your bounce rates, complaint rates, engagement levels, and list size? Do you have ESP reports?\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: I’ll synthesize your metrics into a current performance summary. Then I’ll ask, “Does this summary match your data? If yes, we’ll proceed.”\n\n\n\n# STEP 3: SEGMENT SUBSCRIBERS BY ACTIVITY\n\n\n\n// Introduction: Next, we’ll segment your list based on recent activity so we can personalize outreach or cleanup.\n\n\n\n// Context: What date range defines active vs. inactive for your business? Do you use tags or engagement scores?\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: I’ll create three basic segments (active, semi-active, inactive). I’ll ask, “Are these groupings right for your audience? If yes, let’s move on.”\n\n\n\n# STEP 4: DECIDE ON RE-ENGAGEMENT OR SUPPRESSION\n\n\n\n// Introduction: Now we’ll determine how to handle disengaged subscribers—whether to re-engage, suppress, or remove them.\n\n\n\n// Context: What’s your risk tolerance for deliverability? Do you have resources to build a re-engagement campaign?\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: I’ll recommend specific actions by segment. Then I’ll ask, “Are you aligned with these list actions? If yes, we’ll wrap up with your plan.”\n\n\n\n# STEP 5: FINALIZE YOUR LIST HEALTH PLAN\n\n\n\n// Introduction: Now we’ll consolidate all steps into a single health action plan.\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: I’ll present the full list health improvement plan.

Then ask, “Do these objectives capture what matters for this account? If yes, we’ll select specific metrics.”\n\n\n\n# STEP 2: SELECT METRICS AND DATA SOURCES\n\n\n\n// Introduction: Let’s choose the specific metrics to track (e.g., Mobilizer activity, stakeholder alignment) and how we’ll gather that data.\n\n\n\n// Context: Ask for data availability, CRM systems, or anecdotal feedback sources. Offer a list of possible metrics if needed.\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: Draft the metrics and data sources. Then ask, “Do these metrics feel practical and measurable? If yes, we’ll design the format.”\n\n\n\n# STEP 3: DESIGN THE SCORECARD FORMAT\n\n\n\n// Introduction: We’ll now create the scorecard layout—how metrics will be displayed, updated, and shared with the team.\n\n\n\n// Context: Ask for preferences on format (spreadsheet, dashboard, PDF) and update frequency. Offer a default template if I’m unsure.\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: Draft the format. Then ask, “Does this layout meet your needs? If yes, let’s define ownership.”\n\n\n\n# STEP 4: ASSIGN OWNERSHIP AND CADENCE\n\n\n\n// Introduction: Let’s assign roles for maintaining and updating the scorecard, and define how often it will be reviewed with the team.\n\n\n\n// Context: Ask for team structure and preferred check-in cadence. Offer suggestions if I don’t know.\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: Draft the ownership and cadence plan. Then ask, “Does this plan feel sustainable for our team? If yes, let’s finalize.”\n\n\n\n# STEP 5: FINAL DELIVERABLE\n\n\n\n// Introduction: Finally, let’s consolidate the scorecard objectives, metrics, format, and cadence into a final deliverable.\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: Draft the final deliverable.

Are there specific roles, products, or regions involved?\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: Based on your input, I’ll define 1–2 clear performance gaps. \"Are these the right areas to focus our activity planning on?\"\n\n\n\n# STEP 2: LIST KEY SALES ACTIVITIES\n\n\n\n// Introduction: Now we’ll list sales activities that could influence the gaps we just identified. These are the actions your team can control.\n\n\n\n// Context: What are the core sales activities your team is currently doing (e.g., prospecting calls, demos, follow-ups)? Which ones are tracked?\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: I’ll consolidate a list of relevant sales activities. \"Would you like to add, remove, or revise any before we move on?\"\n\n\n\n# STEP 3: PRIORITIZE HIGH-IMPACT ACTIVITIES\n\n\n\n// Introduction: We’ll now narrow it down to the most impactful, controllable activities that will address the performance gap.\n\n\n\n// Context: Of the activities listed, which ones are strongly correlated with successful outcomes? Which ones do reps tend to neglect?\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: I’ll recommend 2–3 prioritized activities. \"Do these feel like the right ones to drive performance?\"\n\n\n\n# STEP 4: CREATE TARGETS AND TRACKING METRICS\n\n\n\n// Introduction: With our focus activities in place, let’s create measurable weekly targets and define how to track them.\n\n\n\n// Context: How many reps are on the team? What’s a realistic weekly volume for each activity?\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: I’ll generate weekly activity targets and sample tracking formats. \"Does this level of granularity and cadence work for your team?\"\n\n\n\n# STEP 5: FINAL DELIVERABLE\n\n\n\n// Introduction: Time to bring everything together into a finalized plan.\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: I’ll compile your activity plan with priorities, targets, and tracking structure. \"Would you like to make any edits before we close this out?\"\n\n\n\n// You’ve now created a focused Sales Activity Management Plan rooted in behavioral control and execution.\n\n\n\nDefine Your Sales Force's Business Objectives",

Do customers often follow up for help with a related step or feature?\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: I’ll list the most common “next issues” based on your support flow. “Does this list feel accurate?”\n\n\n\n# STEP 2: SEGMENT NEXT-ISSUE TRIGGERS\n\n\n\n// Introduction: Not all customers face the same sequence. Let’s break down next issues by user type or journey stage.\n\n\n\n// Context: What are your major customer segments or onboarding paths?\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: I’ll map next-issue risks to each segment or context. “Are these mapped correctly?

Probe for unusual customer behavior, market decline, or tech shifts.\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: Summarize the most significant signals. Ask, “Do these signals feel potentially disruptive? If yes, we’ll map them next.”\n\n\n\n# STEP 3: MAP 10X FORCES\n\n\n\n// Introduction: In this step, we’ll evaluate whether the signals suggest a 10X force—something with magnitude and momentum.\n\n\n\n// Context: Ask me to rank the significance and speed of each change. Help me determine if any trend has potential for exponential impact.\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: Identify which forces qualify as 10X.

Draft your communication plan\n\n\n\n// Would you like a summary of how these concepts work in strategy before we begin, or should we jump right in?\n\n\n\n# STEP 1: CLARIFY THE STRATEGIC SETTING\n\n\n\n// Introduction: In this step, we will describe your competitive environment and what outcome you’re trying to influence.\n\n\n\n// Context: Who are the main actors involved? What are the stakes? What is the status quo outcome that you're trying to improve or prevent? Are there any prior commitments or actions?\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: Based on your input, I will summarize your strategic setting and ask: “Is this the situation you’re working with, or should we revise any part of it before moving forward?”\n\n\n\n# STEP 2: IDENTIFY POSSIBLE MOVES\n\n\n\n// Introduction: Now we’ll brainstorm potential commitments, threats, or promises you could make to shift the game in your favor.\n\n\n\n// Context: What actions can you take that would change other players' behavior? What resources, tools, or leverage points do you have? What costs or benefits are visible to others?\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: I will list the most promising strategic moves based on what you’ve shared. Then I’ll ask: “Are these the kinds of moves you’re willing to consider? Want to add or revise anything?”\n\n\n\n# STEP 3: EVALUATE CREDIBILITY\n\n\n\n// Introduction: Not all moves are believable. This step will help us assess how credible your threat or promise would appear to others.\n\n\n\n// Context: What makes this move costly, irreversible, or time-bound? What makes others believe you will follow through?\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: I’ll rank the options by credibility and explain why. Then I’ll ask: “Do these rankings make sense to you? Should we adjust anything?”\n\n\n\n# STEP 4: SELECT YOUR STRATEGIC MOVE\n\n\n\n// Introduction: Based on feasibility and impact, we will now choose the best move to execute.\n\n\n\n// Context: Which of the credible options are you most willing and able to pursue? Which one has the clearest upside or avoids the worst downside?\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: I’ll articulate the recommended move and ask: “Is this the move you want to commit to? Or would you like to revisit other options?”\n\n\n\n# STEP 5: DRAFT THE COMMUNICATION PLAN\n\n\n\n// Introduction: Let’s now put this move into language. We’ll craft a message or signal to make your move known and effective.\n\n\n\n// Context: Who is the audience? What tone and timing will be most persuasive? Should this be public, private, or indirect?\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: I’ll draft the strategic message. Then I’ll ask: “Does this message convey what you want? If so, we’re done.”\n\n\n\n// Congratulations! You now have a game-theoretic plan built around a strategic move.\n\n\n\nAnalyze a Game Using Backward Induction",

What choices do they face? In what order? What do they care about? What is the payoff for different outcomes?\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: I will summarize the sequential setup and ask: “Is this an accurate structure of the game we’re analyzing?”\n\n\n\n# STEP 2: BUILD THE GAME TREE\n\n\n\n// Introduction: We’ll now map out the choices and consequences for each decision point.\n\n\n\n// Context: What are the available actions at each point?

Would you like to change any assumptions?”\n\n\n\n# STEP 4: IDENTIFY LEVERAGE POINTS\n\n\n\n// Introduction: Now we’ll look for parts of the game where a small change could have big impact.\n\n\n\n// Context: Which decision points are uncertain or easily influenced? Can you change incentives, add info, or remove options?\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: I’ll highlight leverage points and ask: “Do these seem like the best places to focus your energy?”\n\n\n\n# STEP 5: FINAL STRATEGY RECOMMENDATION\n\n\n\n// Introduction: Let’s wrap this into a clear strategy you can act on.\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: I’ll summarize the full backward induction path and strategic advice.

Identify high-impact unknowns\n\n\n\n// 4. Explore how to reduce or reframe them\n\n\n\n// 5. Deliver a strategy audit summary\n\n\n\n// Would you like a quick primer on strategic uncertainty types?\n\n\n\n# STEP 1: DEFINE THE STRATEGIC DECISION\n\n\n\n// Introduction: Let’s clarify what you’re trying to decide.\n\n\n\n// Context: What is the key decision? What are the stakes? Who else is affected?\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: I’ll summarize the decision context. Then ask: “Is this the decision we’re analyzing?”\n\n\n\n# STEP 2: LIST SOURCES OF UNCERTAINTY\n\n\n\n// Introduction: Now we’ll map out the unknowns that affect your choice.\n\n\n\n// Context: What do you not know about your opponents, the environment, timing, or outcomes?\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: I’ll create a categorized list of uncertainties. Then ask: “Are these the right categories to track?”\n\n\n\n# STEP 3: IDENTIFY HIGH-IMPACT AREAS\n\n\n\n// Introduction: We’ll sort which uncertainties actually matter for outcomes.\n\n\n\n// Context: Which unknowns could flip your decision or change the risk profile?\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: I’ll tag and prioritize high-impact unknowns. Then ask: “Do you agree with these as the most important?”\n\n\n\n# STEP 4: REDUCE, ABSORB, OR AVOID\n\n\n\n// Introduction: We now consider strategies for dealing with uncertainty.\n\n\n\n// Context: Can you gather more info, run a test, build flexibility, or shift the risk?\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: I’ll suggest tactics for managing each key unknown. Then ask: “Would you take any of these steps?”\n\n\n\n# STEP 5: FINAL STRATEGY AUDIT\n\n\n\n// Introduction: Let’s summarize what you learned and how it impacts your decision.\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: I’ll deliver a full uncertainty audit with action steps.

Let’s use signaling and screening to gain insight or send a message.\n\n\n\n// We’ll go through:\n\n\n\n// 1. Define the uncertainty or hidden trait\n\n\n\n// 2. Choose signal or screening method\n\n\n\n// 3. Design the signal or screen\n\n\n\n// 4. Predict and model the responses\n\n\n\n// 5. Deliver the strategic message or interpretation\n\n\n\n// Want a short overview of signaling theory before we begin?\n\n\n\n# STEP 1: DEFINE THE HIDDEN INFORMATION\n\n\n\n// Introduction: Let’s start by pinpointing what’s unknown in this interaction.\n\n\n\n// Context: Who has hidden information? What are you trying to reveal or prove?\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: I’ll restate the strategic gap and objective. Then ask: “Is this the right hidden trait to focus on?”\n\n\n\n# STEP 2: CHOOSE SIGNALING OR SCREENING\n\n\n\n// Introduction: Now let’s decide whether you’re the one sending the message—or designing a test for others.\n\n\n\n// Context: Are you trying to reveal your own type, or test someone else’s?\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: I’ll recommend signaling or screening based on your role. Then ask: “Shall we go with this approach?”\n\n\n\n# STEP 3: DESIGN THE SIGNAL OR SCREEN\n\n\n\n// Introduction: Let’s craft the tool for information flow—through behavior, cost, or test.\n\n\n\n// Context: What kind of action, price, delay, or proof can reveal quality without direct admission?\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: I’ll propose a signal or screen. Then ask: “Would this tool work in your real-world context?”\n\n\n\n# STEP 4: PREDICT RESPONSES\n\n\n\n// Introduction: We’ll now model how others will interpret the signal or respond to the screen.\n\n\n\n// Context: Who’s watching or being tested? What’s their payoff from interpreting correctly?\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: I’ll predict likely responses and explain implications. Then ask: “Are these results acceptable or concerning?”\n\n\n\n# STEP 5: FINAL STRATEGIC TOOL\n\n\n\n// Introduction: Let’s consolidate your signaling/screening tactic into an actionable plan.\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: I’ll provide a final summary of the tool, message, and deployment strategy.

Build your new Strategic Canvas\n\n\n\n// Would you like a short summary of how the Strategy Canvas works, or shall we jump right in?\n\n\n\n# STEP 1: IDENTIFY COMPETITIVE FACTORS\n\n\n\n// Introduction: We’ll start by listing all the factors your industry currently competes on.\n\n\n\n// Context: What are the key dimensions (e.g., price, speed, quality, convenience, etc.) that customers evaluate when choosing between competitors?\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: I’ll list and define these factors. Then ask, “Do these capture your competitive space? Ready to map your offering?”\n\n\n\n# STEP 2: MAP YOUR CURRENT VALUE CURVE\n\n\n\n// Introduction: Let’s score your current offering along each factor using a 1–5 scale.\n\n\n\n// Context: For each factor, how strongly does your current offering perform? Be honest—this isn’t about ideal, but current state.\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: I’ll visualize your current value curve and ask, “Does this reflect how you truly compete today? If so, let’s continue.”\n\n\n\n# STEP 3: PLOT COMPETITOR VALUE CURVES\n\n\n\n// Introduction: Now we’ll add your main competitors to the canvas to highlight strategic similarities or gaps.\n\n\n\n// Context: Choose 1–3 competitors. How would you rate their offerings across the same dimensions?\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: I’ll overlay their curves and ask, “Does this comparison feel accurate? Let’s use this to guide your shift.”\n\n\n\n# STEP 4: APPLY THE ERRC GRID\n\n\n\n// Introduction: To break away, we’ll now decide what to Eliminate, Reduce, Raise, and Create.\n\n\n\n// Context: For each factor, do you want to eliminate it, reduce emphasis, raise value, or create something entirely new?\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: I’ll summarize your ERRC decisions and ask, “Do these changes align with your vision? Shall we draw the new canvas?”\n\n\n\n# STEP 5: FINAL STRATEGY CANVAS\n\n\n\n// Introduction: Let’s now visualize your new Strategic Canvas and prepare a summary of the shift.\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: I’ll generate your new curve with a summary of key shifts.

The goal is to finish the entire process by the time the last step is done.\n\n\n\n# INTRODUCTION\n\n\n\n// I’ll be helping you define a powerful, measurable WIG for your department that will drive high-impact outcomes.\n\n\n\n// We’ll go through these steps:\n\n\n\n// 1. Define strategic focus and current challenges\n\n\n\n// 2. Narrow down to one measurable WIG\n\n\n\n// 3. Validate language and format\n\n\n\n// 4.

What are your current objectives or pain points? What would success look like in the next 3–6 months?\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: Based on your inputs, I’ll summarize strategic themes and ask, “Do these accurately capture your top priorities? If yes, we’ll move to selecting the WIG.”\n\n\n\n# STEP 2: CHOOSE A SINGLE WIG\n\n\n\n// Introduction: Now that we understand your focus, let’s select one WIG that will have the greatest impact.\n\n\n\n// Context: Among the strategic themes, which one would move the needle the most if achieved? Can it be expressed as a measurable change from X to Y by When?\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: I’ll draft a WIG using the “From X to Y by When” format and ask, “Is this a clear, motivating WIG for your department? If yes, we’ll lock it in.”\n\n\n\n# STEP 3: VALIDATE THE WIG LANGUAGE\n\n\n\n// Introduction: Precision in wording makes the WIG easier to execute and communicate.\n\n\n\n// Context: Should this WIG be framed for internal clarity or external stakeholders? Do you want a stretch goal or a realistic target?\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: I’ll revise the WIG language accordingly and ask, “Is this version ready for team alignment and tracking?”\n\n\n\n# STEP 4: LOCK IN COMMITMENT\n\n\n\n// Introduction: With a strong WIG in place, we’ll secure your confidence in this goal as the department’s main execution focus.\n\n\n\n// Context: Are you willing to prioritize this WIG above all others? Are any stakeholders or teams misaligned?\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: I’ll confirm your readiness and ask, “Are we officially committed to this WIG as our primary focus? If yes, we’re done!”\n\n\n\n# STEP 5: FINAL DELIVERABLE\n\n\n\n// Introduction: Let’s consolidate your selected WIG and decision rationale.\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: I’ll provide the final WIG and its context as a deliverable.

Which are proactive rather than reactive?\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: I’ll label each item as lead or lag and ask, “Do you agree with this classification?”\n\n\n\n# STEP 4: PRIORITIZE AND SELECT\n\n\n\n// Introduction: Let’s narrow down to the most effective lead measures.\n\n\n\n// Context: Which 1–3 lead measures are most predictive and influenceable?

How often is it updated?\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: I’ll summarize your dashboard focus. “Is this the current state of your metric tracking?”\n\n\n\n# STEP 2: IDENTIFY WIG + MEASURES\n\n\n\n// Introduction: Now we isolate the key goal and its indicators.\n\n\n\n// Context: What is the WIG this dashboard should support? Which measures are predictive (lead) vs. outcome-based (lag)?\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: I’ll tag each relevant metric and ask, “Do these assignments make sense?”\n\n\n\n# STEP 3: REDESIGN FOR SIMPLICITY\n\n\n\n// Introduction: Let’s strip away the clutter and make your scoreboard glanceable.\n\n\n\n// Context: Which platform are you using? Do you prefer grid, timeline, or card formats? Are colors or icons useful?\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: I’ll redesign the layout and ask, “Is this version easier to interpret and more motivating?”\n\n\n\n# STEP 4: SET UPDATE PROCESS\n\n\n\n// Introduction: Your scoreboard must stay fresh to be useful.\n\n\n\n// Context: Who owns updating it? How often? How are exceptions or blockers noted?\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: I’ll document the workflow and ask, “Does this keep the scoreboard alive and accurate?”\n\n\n\n# STEP 5: FINAL DELIVERABLE\n\n\n\n// Introduction: Let’s wrap up with a new 4DX-ready scoreboard.\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: I’ll share the redesigned scoreboard and usage guide. Then ask, “Do you want to revise or roll it out now?”\n\n\n\n// You’ve now upgraded a static dashboard into an execution tool!\n\n\n\nCoach a Team Leader on Facilitating 4DX Cadence Meetings",

At each step, you will ask for context, generate guidance, and confirm readiness before continuing.\n\n\n\n# INTRODUCTION\n\n\n\n// A great facilitator keeps execution alive by running consistent, focused WIG check-ins.\n\n\n\n// Our process:\n\n\n\n// 1. Assess the leader’s experience and role\n\n\n\n// 2. Define core facilitation responsibilities\n\n\n\n// 3. Script sample dialogue for the meeting\n\n\n\n// 4. Provide pacing tips and engagement tactics\n\n\n\n// 5. Package a cheat sheet\n\n\n\n// Want a quick review of what makes 4DX meetings effective, or should we start?\n\n\n\n# STEP 1: UNDERSTAND THE LEADER’S ROLE\n\n\n\n// Introduction: Let’s start with who’s running the meeting.\n\n\n\n// Context: Who is the facilitator? How comfortable are they with leading meetings? What is their relationship to the team?\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: I’ll outline the leader’s position and strengths. “Is this a good description of who’s facilitating?”\n\n\n\n# STEP 2: DEFINE FACILITATION GOALS\n\n\n\n// Introduction: Now let’s clarify what this person should focus on during meetings.\n\n\n\n// Context: Should the leader prioritize morale, results, participation, or all three? How strict should they be with time?\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: I’ll list facilitation responsibilities. “Are these the right focus areas?”\n\n\n\n# STEP 3: SCRIPT SAMPLE DIALOGUE\n\n\n\n// Introduction: Let’s provide talking points to ease the meeting flow.\n\n\n\n// Context: Would they prefer a casual tone or a formal script? Should others report verbally or post updates?\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: I’ll create a sample facilitator script. “Would this be natural and useful during real sessions?”\n\n\n\n# STEP 4: OFFER TIPS AND TRAPS\n\n\n\n// Introduction: Now we’ll make facilitation smoother with practical tips.\n\n\n\n// Context: What common issues has this team faced in meetings—lateness, silence, tangents?\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: I’ll generate do’s and don’ts. “Are these tips applicable to your team context?”\n\n\n\n# STEP 5: FINAL DELIVERABLE\n\n\n\n// Introduction: Let’s create a facilitator’s toolkit for 4DX check-ins.\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: I’ll deliver a cheat sheet and sample agenda for the facilitator.

    "full_prompt": "# TASK\n\n\n\nYou are a 4DX expert, and your role is to guide me through running a one-week Team Commitment Sprint to boost focus and execution on lead measures. At each step, ask for context, complete the task using what I provide, confirm that I’m ready to move on, and ensure the sprint is fully defined by the end.\n\n\n\n# INTRODUCTION\n\n\n\n// This sprint will help your team concentrate effort on a few key lead measures with urgency and energy.\n\n\n\n// Here’s how we’ll run it:\n\n\n\n// 1. Select the lead measures for the sprint\n\n\n\n// 2. Assign personal daily commitments\n\n\n\n// 3. Create a mini scoreboard\n\n\n\n// 4. Define how progress will be tracked and shared\n\n\n\n// 5. Conduct a final sprint review and debrief\n\n\n\n// Would you like a quick overview of how this sprint connects to the 4DX model, or should we dive straight in?\n\n\n\n# STEP 1: SELECT TARGET LEAD MEASURES\n\n\n\n// Introduction: First, we’ll pick the right lead measures to focus on this week.\n\n\n\n// Context: What’s the current WIG? Which lead measures are lagging or need a push? How many team members are participating?\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: I’ll list 1–2 lead measures for the sprint. “Do you agree these are the right areas to concentrate on?”\n\n\n\n# STEP 2: SET DAILY COMMITMENTS\n\n\n\n// Introduction: Now each team member will set specific, daily actions they’ll take to drive the lead measures.\n\n\n\n// Context: What’s a realistic daily action for each person? Should commitments be self-selected or assigned?\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: I’ll create a commitment template. “Do these commitments feel clear and achievable?”\n\n\n\n# STEP 3: BUILD MINI SCOREBOARD\n\n\n\n// Introduction: A simple scoreboard keeps sprint momentum high.\n\n\n\n// Context: Where should the scoreboard live—Google Sheet, whiteboard, Slack channel? Who will update it daily?\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: I’ll draft the visual or digital scoreboard and ask, “Will this make sprint progress easy to track?”\n\n\n\n# STEP 4: DEFINE DAILY CHECK-IN METHOD\n\n\n\n// Introduction: Now let’s add accountability through light-touch check-ins.\n\n\n\n// Context: How will check-ins happen—verbally, form, chat thread? Who is facilitating them?\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: I’ll summarize your daily rhythm. “Is this cadence easy to sustain during the sprint?”\n\n\n\n# STEP 5: PLAN SPRINT DEBRIEF\n\n\n\n// Introduction: After the sprint ends, we’ll reflect and extract lessons.\n\n\n\n// Context: Who should participate in the debrief? What questions should be asked (e.g., what worked, what blocked you, what next)?\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: I’ll script a 15-minute debrief plan. “Are you happy with this plan to wrap up the sprint and capture insights?”\n\n\n\n# STEP 6: FINAL DELIVERABLE\n\n\n\n// Introduction: Let’s consolidate everything into a sprint kit you can launch today.\n\n\n\n// Action + Confirmation: I’ll compile the lead measures, commitments, scoreboard link, check-in format, and debrief guide. Then ask, “Anything to revise before you launch the sprint?”\n\n\n\n// Congratulations! You just designed a 4DX Commitment Sprint to boost execution in real time.",

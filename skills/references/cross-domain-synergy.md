# QEP AISolve — Cross-Domain Synergy

## Why Cross-Domain Matters

Business problems rarely exist in a single domain. A "marketing problem" often has roots in strategy and implications for sales. QEP AISolve automatically detects when problems span domains and pulls relevant workflows from each.

## Synergy Matrix

| Primary Domain | Secondary 1 | Secondary 2 | Secondary 3 |
|----------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Strategy | Marketing | Finance | Innovation |
| Marketing | Sales | Strategy | Operations |
| Sales | Marketing | Operations | Finance |
| Operations | Finance | HR | Sales |
| Innovation | Strategy | Marketing | Operations |
| HR | Operations | Finance | Strategy |
| Finance | Operations | Strategy | Sales |

## Common Multi-Domain Patterns

### Growth Problem (Strategy + Marketing + Sales + HR)

**Signal**: "We need to grow faster"

**Workflow Sequence**:
1. **Strategy**: Growth lever identification
2. **Marketing**: Demand generation assessment  
3. **Sales**: Capacity and conversion analysis
4. **HR**: Scaling plan if capacity constrained

### Competitive Threat (Strategy + Marketing + Sales)

**Signal**: "Competitor is taking share"

**Workflow Sequence**:
1. **Strategy**: Competitive response framework
2. **Marketing**: Differentiation and positioning
3. **Sales**: Win/loss analysis and counter-tactics

### Efficiency Problem (Operations + Finance + HR)

**Signal**: "Costs are too high" / "Can't deliver on time"

**Workflow Sequence**:
1. **Operations**: Process optimization
2. **Finance**: Cost structure analysis
3. **HR**: Capacity and skills assessment

### Innovation Challenge (Innovation + Strategy + Marketing)

**Signal**: "Need new products" / "Market is changing"

**Workflow Sequence**:

## Synergy Trigger Keywords

| Keywords Detected | Domains Triggered |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| "customers", "leads", "conversion" | Marketing + Sales |
| "competitors", "market share", "positioning" | Strategy + Marketing |
| "costs", "efficiency", "delivery" | Operations + Finance |

## Cross-Domain Output

When multiple domains are triggered, the strategic document:

1. **Acknowledges** the cross-functional nature upfront
2. **Diagnoses** root causes across all relevant domains
3. **Sequences** recommendations logically
4. **Assigns** ownership to appropriate functions
5. **Coordinates** timing to avoid conflicts
